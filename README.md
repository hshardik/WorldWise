# WorldWise

## Overview
WorldWise is an iOS application designed as a demonstration of integrating SwiftUI and UIKit within the same project. The app utilizes the Rest Countries API to fetch and display country information in an engaging and informative manner.

## Features
- Fetches country data from the Rest Countries API.
- Displays country information in a user-friendly list.
- Search functionality to quickly find countries.
- Integration of SwiftUI for modern UI elements.
- Utilization of UIKit components for handling specific functionalities.

## Technologies
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- Combine
- Async/Await
- RESTful APIs
